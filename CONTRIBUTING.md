## Setting the project and debugging a functionality in Visual Studio Code.

1. Download the project locally. (Ofcourse.)
2. Set the debug points in the taiko.js (or any required file)
3. Open the debug Tab in VS Code (Left most Vertical Menu)
4. From the configurations to run, choose 'Program'.
5. Click on Run. 
- The debugger has now been started. But where to fire the commands?-
1. Open the debug console.
2. Import taiko there `const taiko = require('/Users/*/taiko/lib/taiko')`
3. Start firing the commands. eg `taiko.openBrowser()`
- If you have put the debug point in the underlying code, it should break there'
